# Game Jam Template

A simple Game Jam template with the following features:

-Main Menu
-Level Loading (with transitions and loading progress)
-Folder structure (not really a feature)
-Integratioin with [TG Core](https://github.com/tarcisiotm/core) for Object Pooling, Scene Management, etc

The first pass will make this stable and usable, but not optimized yet. After Ludum Dare 46, I'll try to make time to optimize stuff around and try to get closer to a release candidate.

## Dependencies

Fill this out with any paid assets used and their version number (anything under 3rdPartyPaid/ will not be pushed).
